Sequence data was trimmed with TrimGalore [@krueger2021], a wrapper using CutAdapt [@EJ200] for trimming of sequencing primers and adapters and FastQC [@andrews2012] for quality control. Trimmed sequences were assigned to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using dada2[@callahan2016], which includes quality filtering and chimera removal. Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs in dada2 using a custom database created from a highly-resolved phylogeny of ammonia-oxidising archaea [@alves2018]. ASVs were clustered at different cutoffs using the R package DECIPHER [@RJ2016].
